## separate numbers

Write a function that take as input an array of numbers and print out and return two sorted arrays, one of even numbers and another one of odd numbers. sort descending order. Try to make the function cost efficient.

> Extras points if you keep the complexity at O(2n)

## sort me plz

Write a sort function  to numbers in descending order.


## prime or no prime

Write a function that as input a integer N return true if N is a prime number

Write a function take into as input  an array and return the position of all the prime numbers in an array



## geo coordinates

Write a function that take as input  two geo cordinates objects A and B ({lat: xxx, lon: xxx})  and a distance D (in km), and return true if the A is within D km of B.
Ex :
isInRange(A : coords, B: coords, D: number) : boolean. 

```
var paris = {lat:48.864716, lon: 2.349014}

var londres = {lat:51.509865, lon:-0.118092}

var moscow = {lat: 38.736946,   lon: -9.142685};

var d = 500
```


## Determine if two rectangles intersect.

Give an algorithm to solve this problem when rectangles are defined by their width, height, and (x, y) coordinates of their top-left corners.

Give another algorithm where rectangles are defined by their width, height, and (x, y) coordinates of their centers.
What are the behaviors of your algorithms for edge cases?

If you need a tip ask the examiner.

## Validate international phone numbers

Write a function that as input a string S return true if S is an international phone number eg. start with ++ or 00 then has a series of numbers with or without spaces, and no other characters.


## upper case ?
Write a function that determines if a string starts with an upper-case letter A-Z.
try to be efficient.

## What does this function prints ?

```
const values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setInterval(() => {
		print('i is ' + i + 'Of value => ' + values[i]);
  }, 1000)
}
```
